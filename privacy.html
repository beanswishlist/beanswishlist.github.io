      <h1>Beans Wishlist Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h5>Effective Date: Jun 12 2016</h5>
      <h5>Beans Wishlist values your privacy in your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information Beans Wishlist (“Beans”, “the application” or “we” and sometimes “us”) collect about you and why, what we may do with that information.</h5>
      <h2>What Is The Scope Of This Privacy Policy?</h2>
      <h5>This Privacy Policy applies to the information obtained by us through your use of Beans Wishlist.</h5>
      <h2>Will This Privacy Policy Ever Change?</h2>
      <h5>As Beans Wishlist evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in the application, our business and laws applicable to us and you; we will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will post any revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date on our web site.</h5>

<h5>We will ask for your consent to such changes if required by applicable law; in other cases, please note that your continuation of your use of Beans Wishlist after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy, you will need to stop using the application.</h5>
      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <h5>What Information Does Beans Wishlist Collect and Why?</h5>
      <h3>Automated Data Collection</h3>
          <h5>When you access Beans Wishlist, the following data are stored separately from other data that you may have sent us:</h5>
          <h5>* Your date and time of access.</h5>
          <h5>For technical reasons these data are stored and are not assigned to any identifiable person at any time.</h5>
          <h3>Data Entered by Users</h3>
          <h5>You can use the Beans Wishlist both with and without registering. But in order to make use of all its advantages, you have to register. To do this, you must enter your email address and select a password. We require these data in order to guarantee that you are able to make full use of our entire offer. We need these and possibly other data in order to allow you to sync wishes in the same registered account across different devices.</h5>
          <h5>The central function of Beans Wishlist is wish management. You will be able to use this function both online and offline.</h5>
          <h5>Where Beans Wishlist is used solely offline, the data you enter will be stored de-centrally on your storage device. In such a case, we will not be able to access these data.</h5>
          <h5>If you use Beans Wishlist in combination with a registered account, all data and tasks entered will be integrated into a database. The purpose of this database is to allow you to use Beans Wishlist on different devices. Data are transmitted to the respective terminal using SSL encryption so that your data are transmitted securely.</h5>
          <h3>Transfer of Data</h3>
          <h5>We will not transfer your data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance or asking for your prior permission.</h5>
      <h5>When you share your wishes through social media or other options provided in the application, your permission is asked before sharing. And in those cases your personal information is subject to the Privacy Policy of the sharing media you use.</h5>

<h5>We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). It is used to have better understanding of our users like you. And the information collected through Google Analytics covers the following areas:</h5>
